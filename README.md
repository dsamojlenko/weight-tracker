# Weight-tracker

Just a quick little two-person weight-tracker for a new year's resolution competition.

Note that there is no authentication, authorization, or any security features really at all.

It's purpose-built for a two-person challenge, nothing more.

Easily deployable to Heroku with JawsDB MySQL on the free tier.

## Built with
- Laravel
- Chart.js
- Vue
- Tailwindcss

## Responsive
I'm no designer, but it looks ok on desktop or mobile.

## TODO
- Currently,the charts will get messed up if one person misses a day of reporting.
